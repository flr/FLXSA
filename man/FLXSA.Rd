\description{
This function runs an XSA (extended survivor analysis) and creates an FLXSA
object used to analyse its results.

\details{
Virtual population analysis and cohort analysis are essentially accountancy
methods whereby a stock's historical population structure may be
reconstructed from total catch data given a particular level of natural
mortality. Firstly, however, numbers at age in the last year and age have to
be found since both methods iterate backwards down a cohort. The main
problem in many sequential age based assessment methods is therefore to
estimate these terminal population numbers. In XSA these are found from the
relationship between catch per unit effort (CPUE), abundance and year class
strength.

Estimates of the catchability for the oldest age in an assessment, tuned by
the ad hoc or XSA procedures, are directly dependent on the terminal
population or F values used to initialise the underlying VPA. Catchability
at the oldest age is therefore under-determined and cannot be utilised
without additional information. Within the ad hoc tuning procedures the
additional information is obtained by making the assumption that the
exploitation pattern on the oldest ages was constant during the assessment
time series. F on the oldest age in the final year is estimated as a
proportion of an average of the F for preceding ages in the same year. XSA
uses an alternative approach by making the assumption that fleet
catchability is constant (independent of age) above a certain age. The age
(constant for all fleets) is user-defined. For each fleet, the catchability
value estimated at the specified age, is used to derive population abundance
estimates for all subsequent ages in the fleet data set.
